#Modular Plugin System with Vault Creation Plugin

This project implements a modular plugin system using Solidity. The main contract, Core, manages a registry of plugins and can execute them dynamically. Two example plugins are implemented: a simple plugin that multiplies an input value and a vault creation plugin that creates unique vaults.

Requirements
Node.js (v16.x or later)
Hardhat (v2.0.0 or later)
Solidity 0.8.x or later

Setup Instructions:
1. Install Dependencies
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install

2. Compile the Contracts:
To compile the smart contracts, run the following command:
npx hardhat compile

If you face any compilation issues, you can clean the project and recompile by running:
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat compile

4. Start Local Hardhat Node:
To deploy the contracts locally, you first need to start a Hardhat node:
npx hardhat node

This will start a local Ethereum node on localhost:8545.

4. Deploy the Contracts:
Once the local Hardhat node is running, you can deploy the contracts using the following command:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

5. Run the Tests:
To run the tests for the smart contracts, you can use the following command:

npx hardhat test

This will execute the test cases defined in the test/ folder and provide the test results.

7. Network Configuration
Make sure your hardhat.config.js is properly configured to use the local Ethereum network. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.0",
  networks: {
    localhost: {
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8545",  // Local Ethereum network
      accounts: ["<PRIVATE_KEY>"]     // Provide a private key for deployment
    }
  }
};

Replace <PRIVATE_KEY> with a private key from your local Hardhat node or one generated by Hardhat.

Troubleshooting:

Error: Cannot connect to the network localhost
Ensure that the Hardhat node is running with npx hardhat node.
Make sure that your Hardhat configuration file (hardhat.config.js) is correct and the local node is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8545.
Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'executePlugin')
This can happen if a plugin is not correctly added to the Core contract. Check that the plugin addresses are correctly deployed and added before executing them.
